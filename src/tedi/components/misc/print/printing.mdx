# Printing

## Components have built-in styles for printing

- Text colors and some components are converted to grayscale.
- Most background colors are set to white.
- The base font size is 14px, with other font sizes and spacing adjusted accordingly.
- Some components are hidden by default, including Buttons, Anchors, Header, Footer, Breadcrumbs, and Sidenav.
- Expandable components are open by default, such as Accordion, Collapse, and Table subRow/subComponent.
- Page breaks are prevented in certain components (e.g., Placeholder, Table rows). Other page break locations should be defined in the application using the `<Print>` component.  
  _Note: Page breaks do not work in Firefox. See the following issues for more details:_  
  [Bug 1](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1807406), [Bug 2](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1695475), [Bug 3](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=939897)
- Tables are printed by default, but each table should be reviewed on a case-by-case basis. If a table does not fit horizontally, it will include a scrollbar. Tables with many columns may not fit well in the print view.

**The UI can be adjusted using the following methods:**

### `<Print>` component

Preferred method. [More info here](/docs/tedi-ready-components-helpers-print--docs).

### Hooks

- `const isPrinting = usePrint()` - This hook checks if `window.matchMedia('print')` matches. It is useful for conditionally re-rendering the UI during printing.

### Utility classes

**Note:** Use utility classes only when the `<Print>` component cannot be used.

- `no-print` - Hides a component from the print view.
- `show-print` - Shows components in the print view that are hidden by default.
- Determines where page breaks occur during printing. Accepted values include `auto`, `avoid`, `avoid-column`, `avoid-page`, `avoid-region`
  - `break-before-{value}` - Controls how page, column, or region breaks behave **before** a generated box.
  - `break-after-{value}` - Controls how page, column, or region breaks behave **after** a generated box.
  - `break-inside-{value}` - Controls how page, column, or region breaks behave **inside** a generated box.
