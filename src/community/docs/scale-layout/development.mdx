# Grid in development

Every layout in design is makeable with `<Row>` and `<Col>` components. <br/>
All examples of Grid usage are under [Grid docs](/docs/components-grid--docs)

To create vertical spacing between elements use `<VerticalSpacing>` [component](/docs/components-vertical-spacing--docs).

{/* TODO: Need more information how to use Row, Col, VerticalSpacing and Card correctly */}
