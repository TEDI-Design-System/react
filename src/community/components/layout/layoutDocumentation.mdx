# Layout overview

Layout is main wrapper around all components. It is responsible for positioning and sizing general layout components like:

- [Header](/docs/components-layout-header--docs)
- [Sidenav](/docs/components-layout-sidenav--docs)
- [Footer](/docs/components-layout-footer--docs)
- [Breadcrumbs](/docs/components-breadcrumbs-header--docs)
- Main content area

To check out different examples how all those components work togheter under different circumstances, check out [Layout examples](/docs/components-layout-layout--docs)

## Header

Header is **mandatory** in layout.

Currently we support two main header types: `public` and `system`.
Public header is used for public (landing)pages and system header is used for pages that require authentication.
Both headers are using the same markup and styling, but system header has additional functionality like user menu, notifications, etc. <br/>

## Sidenav

Sidenav is used for navigation between pages. It is always visible on desktop and hidden on mobile devices. <br/>
Layout that is meant for public pages can have sidenav on mobile, but on desktop renders navigation to Header. <br />
