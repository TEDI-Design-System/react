/**
 * VerticalProgress is meant to be used with multi step Forms. It provides a visual representation of the steps and
 * allows the user to navigate between them. Visually it's recommended to use <b>TableOfContent</b> component next to VerticalProgress to help user navigate  <br />
 * Logic how the user can navigate between items is up to application. For example:<br />
 * - User can freely navigate between items back and forth
 * - User can only navigate to next item when current item is completed and come back to previous items
 *
 * VerticalProgressItems can have 5 states: 'active', 'completed', 'error', 'disabled' and undefined. <br />
 * - active - Currently open item. No edit button is shown
 * - completed - Item is completed. Edit button is shown when isToggable != false
 * - error - Item has error. Edit button is shown when isToggable != false
 * - disabled - Item is disabled, user can't yet move to this step. Edit button is not shown
 * - undefined - Item is not current, completed, no error and not disabled. Edit button is shown when isToggable != false
 *
 * Every verticalProgressItem can have content, means that completed,disabled etc. state can also have cotent under Title
