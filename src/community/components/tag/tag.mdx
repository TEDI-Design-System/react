    ## Tag usage

    ### Where to use:

    - Organizing information by categorizing or labeling content.
    - Illustrative tags. Ex: name initials.

    ### Where not to use:

    - As a navigation element. Use: link, button. Tags are not interactive elements and should not be used that way.

    ### How to use:

    - Use descriptive short tags, ideally one or two words.
    - Avoid excessive use of tags as it can lead to visual clutter and cognitive overload, diminishing the overall user experience.
    - Accent tags should only be used for illustrative purposes adjacent to text.
